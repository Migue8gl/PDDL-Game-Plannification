# PDDL-Game-Plannification
An approach to PDDL (a domain planning language) for problem solving in a management type game.
The world on which this practice is based is inspired by strategy games
military and resource management, such as StarCraft or Age of Empires. In StarCraft, a group of
space construction vehicles (SCVs) must collect a number of resources to build
new structures, among other possible actions.
each domain and problem file solves a specific planning problem, such as accomplishing the task in the fewest number of steps possible.
